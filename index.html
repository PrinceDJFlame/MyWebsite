            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>I am James Bradley, a boy from England who loves to: code, play Fortnite, Civilization VI, tennis, supports Leeds United FC and Warhammer 40K. I started playing tennis when I was 4 and started coding at 7/8 on an app called Playgrounds. My first ever holiday was when I went to Kilin, Scotland and my more recent one would be Barcelona, Spain.

            <h1>Books, Movies & Music</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>I have read quite a few books, listened to many songs and watched many movies. The most interesting, longest and my favourite book I've read is The Three Musketeers. There are quite a few songs I like, none being as great as my top 3 (3rd is Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes, 2nd is Fuel by Metallica and 1st is Thunderstruck by AC/DC).I wouldn't have my music if I didn't have my Mum and Dad (who first showed me these songs). I have a tied top 3 movies that are all equally as great (the three are Spider-Man: No Way Home, The World of Warcraft Movie and the whole Lord of the Rings series).</p>

            <br>
            <h3>My second holiday was to a static caravan park in Cayton Bay, England. <img src="https://www.mybudgetbreak.com/img/holiday-parks/uk/parkdean/cayton-bay/600x340-parkdean-cayton-bay-holiday-park.jpg" width="300" height="200">We made many memories here when we went to the beach, went to an indoor pool, went to a steam railway, went into Scarborough and so much more. Overall this was an amazing holiday with beautiful weather.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>My third holiday was to Robin Hood's bay. <img src="https://media.rightmove.co.uk/227k/226334/149295140/226334_48497_IMG_00_0000.jpeg" width="300" height="200">I ended up playing in the heat allot, getting splashed by water, went to whitby abbey (where Dracula ,in legends, lived), fell in love with fish and chips, picked up a crab, went to an aquarium got my first 2 fossils (a trilobite and a raptor tooth and a chipped piece of the raptors pelvis) and so much more.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>My fourth holiday was an amazing one when we went on a road trip down south (biggest part being Legoland). <img src="https://www.travalue.ie/contentFiles/holidayImages/legoland-resort-uk.jpg" width="300" height="200">On this holiday we enjoyed a few rides, and the mini lego city, went to weymouth where we heard about a seal, pirate stories and a pirate cove, went to Stonehenge where we saw the stone circle and met our great aunt, went down to Bristol where we saw the SS Great Britain and heard about it's story.</h3>

We went on many trips. We went to the Cave of Zeus, Spinalonga, ancient Minoan civilization (ruins) of knossos which even has the first paved road ever built, a sea fort, lots of pool swimming, lots of nice food, day at Star beach, a rescue aquarium, many cafes, swam in the mediteranean sea for the first time, had tortoises right by our room and heard the very noisy Chicadas.

We went into a local supermarket and sampled many new foods, enjoyed walks on the beach by our hotel, quick transport on trains and trams, I tried Toblerone for the first time, saw the Sagrada Familia and allot more. This was another of my favourite trips.</h3>
